# 2unitBot
This is an IRC chatbot created using Java sockets. There are a few features the bot has, but one of
the main features is being able to webscrape and parse for data and relay it back into the IRC socket. This
is done using Selenium and a Chrome Driver to load the HTML in order for parsing. The data is stored locally
for the a fast runtime instead of implemnenting multiple function calls. 
<ul>
  <li>Programmed exclusively using Java</li>
  <li>Considered and utilized effective runtime analysis </li>
  <li>Implementation of Chrome drivers and HTML parsing</li>
  <li>Websocket and TCP Java API used for connectivity</li>
</ul>
