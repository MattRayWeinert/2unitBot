# 2unitBot
          This is an IRC chatbot created using Java sockets. There are a few features the bot has, but one of
          the main features is being able to webscrape and parse for data and relay it back into the IRC socket. This
          is done using Selenium and a Chrome Driver to load the HTML in order for parsing. The data is stored locally
          for the a fast runtime instead of implemnenting multiple function calls.
